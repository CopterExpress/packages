However tf will continue to be supported for through at least J Turtle.\n","Homepage":"http://www.ros.org/wiki/geometry","Installed-Size":"15","Maintainer":"Tully Foote

The design of rospy favors implementation speed (i.e. developer time) over runtime performance so that algorithms can be quickly prototyped and tested within ROS. It is also ideal for non-critical-path code, such as configuration and initialization code. Many of the ROS tools are written in rospy to take advantage of the type introspection capabilities.
